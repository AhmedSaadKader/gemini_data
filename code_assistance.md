Code prompt:
say hi

Response:
Here's a response to the user's prompt "say hi" considering the provided codebase context:

This application has two modes:  Data Analysis and Code Assistance.  The "say hi" prompt isn't directly actionable within either mode.  To use the application effectively, you need to specify which mode you want to use ('d' for Data Analysis or 'c' for Code Assistance) and then provide an appropriate prompt.

For **Data Analysis ('d')**, the application queries a PostgreSQL database, processes the results, and generates a report.  The prompt for this mode is internally generated based on the database query results.

For **Code Assistance ('c')**,  the application uses the provided codebase context to answer code-related questions. A more relevant prompt for this mode might be:

* "Explain the purpose of `data_analysis.analyze_data_and_generate_report` function."
* "How does the Gemini API integration work?"
* "What are the database connection parameters?"
* "Show the code for handling missing values in the dataframe."

Provide a prompt relevant to code assistance or select the data analysis mode to get a meaningful response.
