# Code Assistance Request: Hello

Here's an assistance based on the provided codebase context:

The provided codebase has two main functionalities: data analysis and code assistance.

**Data Analysis:** This part connects to a PostgreSQL database, retrieves drug data, cleans it, and generates a report summarizing key findings (most frequent active ingredients, companies, drug forms, price ranges, etc.).  The report is formatted as a markdown file.

**Code Assistance:** This component takes a user's code-related question, builds a comprehensive context string including the project structure and the content of all Python files, and then sends this context along with the user's question to an external LLM (likely Gemini). The response from the LLM is then saved to a file.

The user's input "Hello" is too generic for either mode.  To get useful assistance, the user needs to provide a more specific request.  For example:

**For Data Analysis:**

*   "Analyze the drug price distribution and identify the most expensive drugs."
*   "Compare the prevalence of different drug forms across various companies."
*   "Generate a report focusing on the active ingredients used in drugs belonging to the 'Analgesics' group."


**For Code Assistance:**

*   "How can I improve the efficiency of the `handle_missing_values` function?"
*   "Explain the purpose of the `connect_to_db` function."
*   "Suggest a better way to handle errors in the `generate_content` function."
*   "Write a function to calculate the average price of drugs per company."


The current `main.py` script prompts the user to select the mode ('d' for data analysis or 'c' for code assistance).  A more robust application might include better input validation and more informative prompts to guide the user.  Additionally, error handling could be improved throughout the code.  For example, the database connection could include more robust error checks and handling.
