For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

Respond with a JSON array where each object has these exact fields:
- suggestion_number: integer
- original: string (original name)
- proposed: string (new name)
- linguistically_correct: boolean
- maintains_semantics: boolean
- risks: string (description of any risks)

For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

Respond with a JSON array where each object has these exact fields:
- suggestion_number: integer
- original: string (original name)
- proposed: string (new name)
- linguistically_correct: boolean
- maintains_semantics: boolean
- risks: string (description of any risks)
- recommendation: "approve" or "reject"

For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

Respond with a JSON array where each object has these exact fields:
- suggestion_number: integer
- original: string (original name)
- proposed: string (new name)
- linguistically_correct: boolean
- maintains_semantics: boolean
- risks: string (description of any risks)

Change 'Chinese red ginseng extract' to 'chinese red ginseng'
Suggestion 46:
Change 'CI 75470' to 'ci'
Suggestion 47:
Change 'Cimicifuga extract' to 'cimicifuga'
Suggestion 48:
Change 'Cinnamomum camphora bark oil' to 'cinnamomum camphora bark'
Suggestion 49:
Change 'Cinnamomum Camphora Bark Oil' to 'cinnamomum camphora bark'
Suggestion 50:
Change 'Cinnamomum camphora leaf oil' to 'cinnamomum camphora'

For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

Respond with a JSON array where each object has these exact fields:
- suggestion_number: integer
- original: string (original name)
- proposed: string (new name)
- linguistically_correct: boolean
- maintains_semantics: boolean
- risks: string (description of any risks)

For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

Respond with a JSON array where each object has these exact fields:
- suggestion_number: integer
- original: string (original name)
- proposed: string (new name)
- linguistically_correct: boolean
- maintains_semantics: boolean
- risks: string (description of any risks)
- recommendation: "approve" or "reject"

Change 'Eucalyptus globulus oil' to 'eucalyptus globulus'
Suggestion 49:
Change 'Eucalyptus globus leaf oil' to 'eucalyptus globulus'
Suggestion 50:

For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

Respond with a JSON array where each object has these exact fields:
- suggestion_number: integer
- original: string (original name)
- proposed: string (new name)
- linguistically_correct: boolean
- maintains_semantics: boolean
- risks: string (description of any risks)
- recommendation: "approve" or "reject"

For each suggestion, determine:
1. Is the change linguistically correct? Consider spelling, capitalization, and medical terminology.
2. Does it maintain semantic meaning? The change should not alter the fundamental meaning of the ingredient.
3. Are there any risks? Consider potential confusion with other ingredients.
4. Should this change be approved? Provide a clear yes/no recommendation.

Respond with a JSON array where each object has these exact fields:
- suggestion_number: integer
- original: string (original name)
- proposed: string (new name)
- linguistically_correct: boolean
- maintains_semantics: boolean
- risks: string (description of any risks)
